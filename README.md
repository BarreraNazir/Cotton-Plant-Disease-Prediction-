 # Cotton-Plant-Disease-Prediction-Using-CNN-Model

**Problem** = Manually diagnose the disease from large field of crop is still a problem in today's world. Immediate action required to cure the early stage of disease results maintaining quality of products.

**Solution** = Automatic system designed to detect the disease from plant leaves using convolutional neural network.

**Description**
        The dataset is taken from Kaggle repository and import it from keras: Image Data Generator. Input contain 1961 training and 324 validation images with class mode categorical named as diseased cotton leaf, diseased cotton plant, fresh cotton leaf, and fresh cotton plant. To build this model, Convolutional Neural Network is used with 500 epoch. The model predicted 89 % accuracy to predict disease. At the end, the different images were tested to check the performance of the model.
